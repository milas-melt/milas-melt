### Uhh .. hello world? ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a financial engineering python library for buy-side @ Sigtech
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things lol. Mainly in the field of Data Science & Finance (with a focus on quant finance)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/Moroccan-Databases) project or any DeFi flashloan idea as well as any Afria fintech idea
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/Moroccan-Databases) or [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/multi-character-AI-bot) or [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/dj_station) (I promise they're not the same link)
