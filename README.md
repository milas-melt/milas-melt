### Uhh .. hello world? ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying & working in financial engineering (@ICL, @Sigtech)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things lol. Mainly in the field of Machine Learning & Finance (with a focus on quant finance)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/Moroccan-Databases) project or any DeFi flashloan idea as well as any Africa fintech idea
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/Moroccan-Databases) or [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/multi-character-AI-bot) or [this](https://github.com/milas-melt/dj_station) (I promise they're not the same link)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm currently writing this to avoid working on my exams
- I deeply care about my home continent Africa, and am thinking of ways to improve Fintech in Morocco with the hope to find a solution that scales in Africa. More precisely, I am looking at credit scoring in Morocco. In parallel, I am studying the hardware of stock exchanges in Africa.
